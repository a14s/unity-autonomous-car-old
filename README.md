# unity-autonomous-car

### The goal of this project was to develop the software required for an Autonomous Car to navigate safely through a track. A simulation has been conducted in Unity with an autonomous car model equipped with Lidar and Camera sensors.
### Traffic signs and lights are detected to navigate lawfully through the track and localized in the local map. Lane paths were detected and recognized using clustering algorithms. Control algorithms were also developed for the path following of the vehicle.
